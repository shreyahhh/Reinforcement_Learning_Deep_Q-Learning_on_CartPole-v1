# Deep Q-Learning on CartPole-v1 ðŸ§ ðŸŽ®

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart using OpenAI's CartPole-v1 environment.


## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Reinforcement learning is used to train an agent to interact with its environment and learn an optimal policy. This notebook implements:
- A Q-network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Experience replay
- A target network for stable learning
- Epsilon-greedy policy for exploration
